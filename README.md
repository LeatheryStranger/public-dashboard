# Esphome E-Ink Dashboard
Created mostly myself with inspiration from the following repository(s):
- [E-Ink Ambient Display](https://github.com/owenb321/eink_ambient_display)
  
Using the Esphome yaml syntax with A fair amount of C++ I was able to create a weather station/notification center for my family.  It also takes the headlines from a news source of your choice (mines the town news) and will display that on the bottom half if you have no notifications.  
I used the following parts to create the Dashboard:
- [Waveshare E-ink display 7.5in](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/epaper-1/7.5inch-e-paper.htm)
- [Waveshare ESP32 driver board](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/driver-boards/e-paper-esp32-driver-board.htm)
- Generic target frame
- Generic picture mat
  
Cutting out the mat was tricky but other than that it was a pretty straightforward build.
